# YouTube
YouTube is a command-line utility that acts as a wrapper around a few other projects. Specifically, the PyTube, and youtube-search-python modules.
This allows you to search for different kinds of content, download features like the video itself (across any format that FFmpeg supports), the
thumbnails, and more, all in an interactive way.
